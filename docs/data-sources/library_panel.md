# grafana_library_panel (Data Source)

Data source for retrieving a single library panel by name or uid.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// create a minimal library panel inside the General folder
resource "grafana_library_panel" "test" {
  name      = "test name"
  folder_id = 0 // General folder
  model_json = jsonencode({
    title   = "test name"
    type    = "text"
    version = 0
  })
}

data "grafana_library_panel" "from_name" {
  name = grafana_library_panel.test.name
}

data "grafana_library_panel" "from_uid" {
  uid = grafana_library_panel.test.id
}

// create library panels to be added to a dashboard
resource "grafana_library_panel" "dashboard" {
  name      = "panel"
  folder_id = 0
  model_json = jsonencode({
    gridPos = {
      x = 0
      y = 0
      h = 10
    w = 10 }
    title = "panel"
    type  = "text"
  version = 0 })
}

// create a dashboard using the library panel
// `merge()` will add `libraryPanel` attribute to each library panel JSON
// Grafana will then connect any library panels found in dashboard JSON
resource "grafana_dashboard" "with_library_panel" {
  config_json = jsonencode({
    id = 12345
    panels = [
      merge(jsondecode(grafana_library_panel.dashboard.model_json), {
        libraryPanel = {
          name = grafana_library_panel.dashboard.name
          uid  = grafana_library_panel.dashboard.uid
        }
      })
    ]
    title         = "Production Overview"
    tags          = ["templated"]
    timezone      = "browser"
    schemaVersion = 16
    version       = 0
    refresh       = "25s"
  })
}

// dashboard_ids list attribute should contain dashboard id 12345
data "grafana_library_panel" "connected_to_dashboard" {
  uid = grafana_library_panel.dashboard.uid

  // the dashboard must be created before reading the library panel data
  depends_on = [grafana_dashboard.with_library_panel]
}

data "grafana_dashboard" "from_library_panel_connection" {
  dashboard_id = data.grafana_library_panel.connected_to_dashboard.dashboard_ids[0]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **name** (String) Name of the library panel.
- **uid** (String) The unique identifier (UID) of a library panel uniquely identifies library panels between multiple Grafana installs. It’s automatically generated unless you specify it during library panel creation.The UID provides consistent URLs for accessing library panels and when syncing library panels between multiple Grafana installs.

### Read-Only

- **created** (String) Timestamp when the library panel was created.
- **dashboard_ids** (List of Number) Numerical IDs of Grafana dashboards containing the library panel.
- **description** (String) Description of the library panel.
- **folder_id** (Number) ID of the folder where the library panel is stored.
- **folder_name** (String) Name of the folder containing the library panel.
- **folder_uid** (String) Unique ID (UID) of the folder containing the library panel.
- **model_json** (String) The JSON model for the library panel.
- **org_id** (Number) The numeric ID of the library panel computed by Grafana.
- **panel_id** (Number) The numeric ID of the library panel computed by Grafana.
- **type** (String) Type of the library panel (eg. text).
- **updated** (String) Timestamp when the library panel was last modified.
