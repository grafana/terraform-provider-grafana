## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the CloudWatch Scrape Job. Part of the Terraform Resource ID.
- `stack_id` (String) The Stack ID of the Grafana Cloud instance. Part of the Terraform Resource ID.

### Read-Only

- `aws_account_resource_id` (String) The ID assigned by the Grafana Cloud Provider API to an AWS Account resource that should be associated with this CloudWatch Scrape Job. This can be provided by the `resource_id` attribute of the `grafana_cloud_provider_aws_account` resource.
- `custom_namespace` (Block List) Zero or more configuration blocks to configure custom namespaces for the CloudWatch Scrape Job to scrape. Each block must have a distinct `name` attribute. When accessing this as an attribute reference, it is a list of objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--custom_namespace))
- `disabled_reason` (String) When the CloudWatch Scrape Job is disabled, this will show the reason that it is in that state.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the CloudWatch Scrape Job is enabled or not.
- `export_tags` (Boolean) When enabled, AWS resource tags are exported as Prometheus labels to metrics formatted as `aws_<service_name>_info`.
- `id` (String) The Terraform Resource ID. This has the format "{{ stack_id }}:{{ name }}".
- `regions` (Set of String) The set of AWS region names that this CloudWatch Scrape Job is configured to scrape.
- `regions_subset_override_used` (Boolean) When true, the `regions` attribute will be the set of regions configured in the override. When false, the `regions` attribute will be the set of regions belonging to the AWS Account resource that is associated with this CloudWatch Scrape Job.
- `role_arn` (String) The AWS ARN of the IAM role associated with the AWS Account resource that is being used by this CloudWatch Scrape Job.
- `service` (Block List) One or more configuration blocks to dictate what this CloudWatch Scrape Job should scrape. Each block must have a distinct `name` attribute. When accessing this as an attribute reference, it is a list of objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--service))
