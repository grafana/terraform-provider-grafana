## Schema

### Required

- `config_json` (String) The complete dashboard model JSON.

### Optional

- `folder` (String) The id or UID of the folder to save the dashboard in.
- `message` (String) Set a commit message for the version history.
- `org_id` (String) The Organization ID. If not set, the Org ID defined in the provider block will be used.
- `overwrite` (Boolean) Set to true if you want to overwrite existing dashboard with newer version, same dashboard title in folder or same dashboard uid.

### Read-Only

- `dashboard_id` (Number) The numeric ID of the dashboard computed by Grafana.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `uid` (String) The unique identifier of a dashboard. This is used to construct its URL. It's automatically generated if not provided when creating a dashboard. The uid allows having consistent URLs for accessing dashboards and when syncing dashboards between multiple Grafana installs.
- `url` (String) The full URL of the dashboard.
- `version` (Number) Whenever you save a version of your dashboard, a copy of that version is saved so that previous versions of your dashboard are not lost.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import grafana_dashboard.name "{{ uid }}"
terraform import grafana_dashboard.name "{{ orgID }}:{{ uid }}"
```
