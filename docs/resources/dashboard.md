## Schema

### Required

- **config_json** (String) The complete dashboard model JSON.

### Optional

- **config_json_sha256** (Boolean) Set to true if you want to save only the sha256sum instead of complete dashboard model JSON in the tfstate.
- **folder** (Number) The id of the folder to save the dashboard in.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **message** (String) Set a commit message for the version history.
- **overwrite** (Boolean) Set to true if you want to overwrite existing dashboard with newer version, same dashboard title in folder or same dashboard uid.

### Read-Only

- **dashboard_id** (Number) The numeric ID of the dashboard computed by Grafana.
- **slug** (String, Deprecated) URL friendly version of the dashboard title. This field is deprecated, please use `uid` instead.
- **uid** (String) The unique identifier of a dashboard. This is used to construct its URL. It’s automatically generated if not provided when creating a dashboard. The uid allows having consistent URLs for accessing dashboards and when syncing dashboards between multiple Grafana installs.
- **version** (Number) Whenever you save a version of your dashboard, a copy of that version is saved so that previous versions of your dashboard are not lost.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import grafana_dashboard.dashboard_name {{dashboard_slug}}
```
