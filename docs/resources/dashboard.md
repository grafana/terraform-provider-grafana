- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **message** (String) Set a commit message for the version history.
- **overwrite** (Boolean) Set to true if you want to overwrite existing dashboard with newer version, same dashboard title in folder or same dashboard uid.

### Read-Only

- **dashboard_id** (Number) The numeric ID of the dashboard computed by Grafana.
