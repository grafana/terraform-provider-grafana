# grafana_apps_alertenrichment_alertenrichment_v1beta1 (Resource)

Manages Grafana Alert Enrichments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "grafana_apps_alertenrichment_alertenrichment_v1beta1" "example" {
  metadata = {
    uid = "alert-enrichment-example"
  }

  spec {
    title       = "Critical Alert Enrichment Pipeline"
    description = "Enriches critical production alerts with team information"

    # Apply only to specific alert rules
    alert_rule_uids = ["high-cpu-alert", "disk-space-alert"]

    # Apply only to specific receivers
    receivers = ["critical-alerts", "alerting-team"]

    # Match alerts with specific labels
    label_matchers = [
      {
        type  = "="
        name  = "severity"
        value = "critical"
      },
      {
        type  = "=~" # Regex match
        name  = "environment"
        value = "prod.*"
      },
      {
        type  = "!="
        name  = "team"
        value = "test"
      }
    ]

    # Match alerts with specific annotations
    annotation_matchers = [
      {
        type  = "!~" # Regex not match
        name  = "runbook_url"
        value = "^http://grafana.com$"
      }
    ]

    assign_step {
      annotations = {
        enrichment_team   = "alerting-team"
        runbook_url       = "https://runbooks.grafana.com/critical-alerts"
        contact_slack     = "#alerts-critical"
        incident_severity = "high"
      }
      timeout = "30s"
    }

- `spec` (Block, Optional) The spec of the resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the resource derived from UUID.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `uid` (String) The unique identifier of the resource.

Optional:

- `folder_uid` (String) The UID of the folder to save the resource in.

Read-Only:

- `url` (String) The full URL of the resource.
- `uuid` (String) The globally unique identifier of a resource, used by the API for tracking.
- `version` (String) The version of the resource.


<a id="nestedblock--options"></a>

<a id="nestedblock--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `title` (String) The title of the alert enrichment.

Optional:

- `alert_rule_uids` (List of String) UIDs of alert rules this enrichment applies to. If empty, applies to all alert rules.
- `annotation_matchers` (List of Object) Annotation matchers that an alert must satisfy for this enrichment to apply. Each matcher is an object with: 'type' (string, one of: =, !=, =~, !~), 'name' (string, annotation key to match), 'value' (string, annotation value to compare against, supports regex for =~/!~ operators). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--annotation_matchers))

- `description` (String) Description of the alert enrichment.
- `label_matchers` (List of Object) Label matchers that an alert must satisfy for this enrichment to apply. Each matcher is an object with: 'type' (string, one of: =, !=, =~, !~), 'name' (string, label key to match), 'value' (string, label value to compare against, supports regex for =~/!~ operators). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--label_matchers))
- `receivers` (List of String) Receiver names to match. If empty, applies to all receivers.

### Nested Schema for `spec.annotation_matchers`

Optional:

- `name` (String)
- `type` (String)
- `value` (String)


<a id="nestedblock--spec--assign_step"></a>

<a id="nestedatt--spec--label_matchers"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.label_matchers`
