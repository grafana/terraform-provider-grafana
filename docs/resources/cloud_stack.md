## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of stack. Conventionally matches the url of the instance (e.g. `<stack_slug>.grafana.net`).
- `slug` (String) Subdomain that the Grafana instance will be available at. Setting slug to `<stack_slug>` will make the instance available at `https://<stack_slug>.grafana.net`.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of stack.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of labels to assign to the stack. Label keys and values must match the following regexp: "^[a-zA-Z0-9/\\-.]+$" and stacks cannot have more than 10 labels.
- `region_slug` (String) Region slug to assign to this stack. Changing region will destroy the existing stack and create a new one in the desired region. Use the region list API to get the list of available regions: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/developer-resources/api-reference/cloud-api/#list-regions.
- `url` (String) Custom URL for the Grafana instance. Must have a CNAME setup to point to `.grafana.net` before creating the stack
- `wait_for_readiness` (Boolean) Whether to wait for readiness of the stack after creating it. The check is a HEAD request to the stack URL (Grafana instance). Defaults to `true`.
- `wait_for_readiness_timeout` (String) How long to wait for readiness (if enabled). Defaults to `5m0s`.
