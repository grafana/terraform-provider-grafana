## Schema

### Required

- `folder_uid` (String) The UID of the folder that the group belongs to.
- `interval_seconds` (Number) The interval, in seconds, at which all rules in the group are evaluated. If a group contains many rules, the rules are evaluated sequentially.
- `name` (String) The name of the rule group.
- `org_id` (String) The ID of the org to which the group belongs.
- `rule` (Block List, Min: 1) The rules within the group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule`

Required:

- `condition` (String) The `ref_id` of the query node in the `data` field to use as the alert condition.
- `data` (Block List, Min: 1) A sequence of stages that describe the contents of the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--data))
- `name` (String) The name of the alert rule.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Key-value pairs of metadata to attach to the alert rule that may add user-defined context, but cannot be used for matching, grouping, or routing. Defaults to `map[]`.
- `exec_err_state` (String) Describes what state to enter when the rule's query is invalid and the rule cannot be executed. Options are OK, Error, and Alerting. Defaults to `Alerting`.
- `for` (String) The amount of time for which the rule must be breached for the rule to be considered to be Firing. Before this time has elapsed, the rule is only considered to be Pending. Defaults to `0`.
- `labels` (Map of String) Key-value pairs to attach to the alert rule that can be used in matching, grouping, and routing. Defaults to `map[]`.
- `no_data_state` (String) Describes what state to enter when the rule's query returns No Data. Options are OK, NoData, and Alerting. Defaults to `NoData`.

Read-Only:

- `uid` (String) The unique identifier of the alert rule.

<a id="nestedblock--rule--data"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule.data`

Required:

- `datasource_uid` (String) The UID of the datasource being queried, or "-100" if this stage is an expression stage.
- `model` (String) Custom JSON data to send to the specified datasource when querying.
- `ref_id` (String) A unique string to identify this query stage within a rule.
- `relative_time_range` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The time range, relative to when the query is executed, across which to query. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--data--relative_time_range))

Optional:

- `query_type` (String) An optional identifier for the type of query being executed. Defaults to ``.

<a id="nestedblock--rule--data--relative_time_range"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule.data.relative_time_range`

Required:

- `from` (Number) The number of seconds in the past, relative to when the rule is evaluated, at which the time range begins.
- `to` (Number) The number of seconds in the past, relative to when the rule is evaluated, at which the time range ends.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import grafana_rule_group.rule_group_name {{folder_uid}};{{rule_group_name}}
```
