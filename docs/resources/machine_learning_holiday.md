# grafana_machine_learning_holiday (Resource)

A holiday describes time periods where a time series is expected to behave differently to normal.

To use a holiday in a job, use its id in the `holidays` attribute of a `grafana_machine_learning_job`:

```terraform
resource "grafana_machine_learning_job" "test_job" {
  ...
  holidays = [
    grafana_machine_learning_holiday.my_holiday.id
  ]
}
```

## Example Usage

### iCal Holiday

This holiday uses an iCal file to define the holidays.

```terraform
resource "grafana_machine_learning_holiday" "ical" {
  name        = "My iCal holiday"
  description = "My Holiday"

  ical_url      = "https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/en.uk%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics"
  ical_timezone = "Europe/London"
}
```

### Custom Periods Holiday

This holiday uses custom periods to define the holidays.

```terraform
resource "grafana_machine_learning_holiday" "custom_periods" {
  name        = "My custom periods holiday"
  description = "My Holiday"

  custom_periods {
    name       = "First of January"
    start_time = "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    end_time   = "2023-01-02T00:00:00Z"
  }
  custom_periods {
    name       = "First of Feburary"
    start_time = "2023-02-01T00:00:00Z"
    end_time   = "2023-02-02T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import grafana_machine_learning_holiday.name "{{ id }}"
```
