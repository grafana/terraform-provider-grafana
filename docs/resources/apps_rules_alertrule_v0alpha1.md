- `version` (String) The version of the resource.


<a id="nestedblock--options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `options`

Optional:

- `overwrite` (Boolean) Set to true if you want to overwrite existing resource with newer version, same resource title in folder or same resource uid.


<a id="nestedblock--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `exec_err_state` (String) Describes what state to enter when the rule's query is invalid and the rule cannot be executed. Options are OK, Error, KeepLast, and Alerting.
- `expressions` (Dynamic) A sequence of stages that describe the contents of the rule.

### Nested Schema for `spec.notification_settings`

Required:

- `contact_point` (String) The contact point to route notifications that match this rule to.

Optional:

- `active_timings` (List of String) A list of time interval names to apply to alerts that match this policy to suppress them unless they are sent at the specified time.
- `group_by` (List of String) A list of alert labels to group alerts into notifications by.
- `group_interval` (String) Minimum time interval between two notifications for the same group.
- `group_wait` (String) Time to wait to buffer alerts of the same group before sending a notification.
- `mute_timings` (List of String) A list of mute timing names to apply to alerts that match this policy.
- `repeat_interval` (String) Minimum time interval for re-sending a notification if an alert is still firing.


<a id="nestedblock--spec--trigger"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.trigger`

Required:

- `interval` (String) The interval at which the alert rule should be evaluated.
