# grafana_notification_policy (Resource)

Sets the global notification policy for Grafana.

!> This resource manages the entire notification policy tree and overwrites its policies. However, it does not overwrite internal policies created when alert rules directly set a contact point for notifications.

* [Official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/set-up/provision-alerting-resources/terraform-provisioning/)
* [HTTP API](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/alerting_provisioning/#notification-policies)

This resource requires Grafana 9.1.0 or later.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "grafana_contact_point" "a_contact_point" {
  name = "A Contact Point"

  email {
    addresses = ["one@company.org", "two@company.org"]
    message   = "{{ len .Alerts.Firing }} firing."
  }
}

resource "grafana_mute_timing" "a_mute_timing" {
  name = "Some Mute Timing"

  intervals {
    weekdays = ["monday"]
  }
}

resource "grafana_mute_timing" "working_hours" {
  name = "Working Hours"
  intervals {
    times {
      start = "09:00"
      end   = "18:00"
    }
  }
}


resource "grafana_notification_policy" "my_notification_policy" {
  group_by      = ["..."]
  contact_point = grafana_contact_point.a_contact_point.name

  group_wait      = "45s"
  group_interval  = "6m"
  repeat_interval = "3h"

  policy {
    matcher {
      label = "mylabel"
      match = "="
      value = "myvalue"
    }
    matcher {
      label = "alertname"
      match = "="
      value = "CPU Usage"
    }
    matcher {
      label = "Name"
      match = "=~"
      value = "host.*|host-b.*"
    }
    contact_point  = grafana_contact_point.a_contact_point.name // This can be omitted to inherit from the parent
    continue       = true
    mute_timings   = [grafana_mute_timing.a_mute_timing.name]
    active_timings = [grafana_mute_timing.working_hours.name]

    group_wait      = "45s"
    group_interval  = "6m"
    repeat_interval = "3h"

    policy {
      matcher {
        label = "sublabel"
        match = "="
        value = "subvalue"
      }
      contact_point = grafana_contact_point.a_contact_point.name // This can also be omitted to inherit from the parent's parent
      group_by      = ["..."]
    }
  }

  policy {
    matcher {
      label = "anotherlabel"
      match = "=~"
      value = "another value.*"
    }
    contact_point = grafana_contact_point.a_contact_point.name
    group_by      = ["..."]
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `contact_point` (String) The default contact point to route all unmatched notifications to.
- `group_by` (List of String) A list of alert labels to group alerts into notifications by. Use the special label `...` to group alerts by all labels, effectively disabling grouping.

### Optional

- `disable_provenance` (Boolean) Allow modifying the notification policy from other sources than Terraform or the Grafana API. Defaults to `false`.
- `group_interval` (String) Minimum time interval between two notifications for the same group. Default is 5 minutes.
- `group_wait` (String) Time to wait to buffer alerts of the same group before sending a notification. Default is 30 seconds.
- `org_id` (String) The Organization ID. If not set, the Org ID defined in the provider block will be used.
- `policy` (Block List) Routing rules for specific label sets. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policy))
- `repeat_interval` (String) Minimum time interval for re-sending a notification if an alert is still firing. Default is 4 hours.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `policy`

Optional:

- `active_timings` (List of String) A list of time interval names to apply to alerts that match this policy to suppress them unless they are sent at the specified time. Supported in Grafana 12.1.0 and later
- `contact_point` (String) The contact point to route notifications that match this rule to.
- `continue` (Boolean) Whether to continue matching subsequent rules if an alert matches the current rule. Otherwise, the rule will be 'consumed' by the first policy to match it.
- `group_by` (List of String) A list of alert labels to group alerts into notifications by. Use the special label `...` to group alerts by all labels, effectively disabling grouping. Required for root policy only. If empty, the parent grouping is used.
- `group_interval` (String) Minimum time interval between two notifications for the same group. Default is 5 minutes.
- `group_wait` (String) Time to wait to buffer alerts of the same group before sending a notification. Default is 30 seconds.
- `matcher` (Block Set) Describes which labels this rule should match. When multiple matchers are supplied, an alert must match ALL matchers to be accepted by this policy. When no matchers are supplied, the rule will match all alert instances. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policy--matcher))
- `mute_timings` (List of String) A list of time intervals to apply to alerts that match this policy to mute them for the specified time.
- `policy` (Block List) Routing rules for specific label sets. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policy--policy))
- `repeat_interval` (String) Minimum time interval for re-sending a notification if an alert is still firing. Default is 4 hours.

### Nested Schema for `policy.matcher`

Required:

- `match` (String) The operator to apply when matching values of the given label. Allowed operators are `=` for equality, `!=` for negated equality, `=~` for regex equality, and `!~` for negated regex equality.
- `value` (String) The label value to match against.
