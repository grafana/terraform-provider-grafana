# grafana\_dashboard

The dashboard resource allows a dashboard to be created on a Grafana server.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "grafana_dashboard" "metrics" {
  config_json = "${file("grafana-dashboard.json")}"
}
```

Dashboards can be exported from Grafana's web UI in JSON format and provided
via the `config_json` argument.

The exported JSON will include references to Grafana data sources, but the
data source configuration is not exported in this way. In order to fully
manage a dashboard with Terraform, necessary data sources can be created
using the `grafana_data_source` resource. In order to ensure that a data
source is created before a dashboard that refers to it, use the `depends_on`
meta-parameter:

```hcl
depends_on = ["grafana_data_source.metrics"]
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `config_json` - (Required) The JSON configuration for the dashboard.
* `folder` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The internal id of the folder
  in Grafana in which to place the dashboard.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `slug` - A URL "slug" for this dashboard, generated by Grafana by removing
  certain characters from the dashboard name given as part of the `config_json`
  argument. This can be used to generate the URL for a dashboard.
* `dashboard_id` - The numeric ID of the dashboard computed by Grafana.

## Import

Existing organizations can be imported using the dashboard "slug" which can be
obtained from the url of the dashboard in Grafana (e.g. `https://grafana.mydomain.com/d/abcdef-gh/dashboard-slug`)

```
$ terraform import grafana_dashboard.dashboard_name {dashboard_slug}
```
