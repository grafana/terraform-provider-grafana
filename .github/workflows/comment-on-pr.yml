            In order to lower resource usage and have a faster runtime, PRs will not run Cloud tests automatically. To do so, a Grafana Labs employee must promote the Drone build.
            
            _For maintainers_, it's better to run only the Cloud tests you need, rather than all of them. You can do so by setting the following parameter when promoting:
            
            `TESTARGS='-run=<testname>'`
